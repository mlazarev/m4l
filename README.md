This is an multi-oscillator monophonic synthesizer based on a harmonic series of sine waves. When you kick off the "Laz!" a random 'drunken' walk function kicks in and begins
to modulate the amplitude of all the sine waves in the harmonic series (except the fundamental). This creates a constantly mutating timbre in the sound which is great for slow evolving drones or fast fluttering pads.

### Changelog
v0.1 - Initial commit with a new **Rate** control.

v0.2 - Added **Depth** of the steps (essentially modulation) as well as **Smooth** function to control the rate of ramp up to the next value.
