## Lazmonizer

This is an multi-oscillator monophonic synthesizer based on a harmonic series of sine waves. When you enable the "Laz!" function, a random walk function kicks in and begins
to modulate the amplitude of all the sine waves after the fundamental. This creates a constantly mutating timbre in the sound which is fantastic for slow evolving drones 
or fast fluttering pads, the rate of which you can control or automate in Ableton.
