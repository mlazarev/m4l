## Lazmonizer

This is an multi-oscillator monophonic synthesizer based on a harmonic series of sine waves. When you kick off the "Laz!" a random 'drunken' walk function begins
to modulate the amplitude of all the sine waves in the harmonic series (except the fundamental). This creates a constantly mutating timbre in the sound which is great for slow evolving drones or fast fluttering pads.

See [README](https://github.com/mlazarev/m4l/tree/main/lazmonizer) for a quick manual.
